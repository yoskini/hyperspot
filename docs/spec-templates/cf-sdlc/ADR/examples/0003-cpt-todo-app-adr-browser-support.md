# ADR-0003: Browser Support Policy

**ID**: `cpt-examples-todo-app-adr-browser-support`

## Context and Problem Statement

The Todo App is a browser-based application and relies on modern platform capabilities (IndexedDB, Service Worker, WebSocket). We need a clear browser support policy to balance compatibility with development complexity.

## Decision Drivers

- Ensure offline-first features work reliably
- Keep implementation complexity reasonable
- Align with typical user environments for a personal productivity app

## Considered Options

- Support only Chrome (fastest development)
- Support latest 2 versions of major browsers
- Support long-tail legacy browsers

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Support latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge**.

### Consequences

- Good, because offline-first primitives (IndexedDB) are available and stable
- Good, because aligns with modern browser update cadence
- Bad, because we may need small compatibility shims across engines

### Confirmation

Confirmed via:

- Browser test matrix execution (latest 2 versions policy) in CI
- Manual smoke test of offline-first flows across supported browsers

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Support only Chrome

* Good, because fastest development — single engine
* Bad, because excludes significant user base
* Bad, because vendor lock-in risk

### Support latest 2 versions of major browsers

* Good, because covers 95%+ of users
* Good, because modern APIs (IndexedDB, WebSocket) are stable
* Bad, because minor compatibility shims may be needed

### Support long-tail legacy browsers

* Good, because maximum user coverage
* Bad, because significant polyfill overhead
* Bad, because key features (Service Worker, IndexedDB) unreliable in old browsers

## Traceability
