## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates DECOMPOSITION artifacts (design breakdown into features)
- [ ] I have access to the source DESIGN artifact being decomposed
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will use the [Reporting](#reporting) format for output

---

## Applicability Context

**Purpose of DECOMPOSITION artifact**: Break down the overall DESIGN into implementable work packages (features) that can be assigned, tracked, and implemented independently.

**What this checklist tests**: Quality of the decomposition itself — not the quality of requirements, design decisions, security, performance, or other concerns. Those belong in PRD and DESIGN checklists.

**Key principle**: A perfect decomposition has:
1. **100% coverage** — every design element appears in at least one feature
2. **No overlap** — no design element appears in multiple features without clear reason
3. **Complete attributes** — every feature has identification, purpose, scope, dependencies
4. **Consistent granularity** — features are at similar abstraction levels
5. **Bidirectional traceability** — can trace both ways between design and features

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Decomposition is fundamentally broken; cannot proceed to implementation.
- **HIGH**: Significant decomposition gap; should be fixed before implementation starts.
- **MEDIUM**: Decomposition improvement needed; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Checkpointing (Long Reviews)

### Checkpoint After Each Domain

After completing each expertise domain (COV, EXC, ATTR, etc.), output:
```
✓ {DOMAIN} complete: {N} items checked, {M} issues found
Issues: {list issue IDs}
Remaining: {list unchecked domains}
```

### Minimum Viable Review

If full review impossible, prioritize in this order:
1. **COV-001** (CRITICAL) — WBS 100% Rule
2. **EXC-001** (CRITICAL) — Mutual Exclusivity
3. **ATTR-001** (HIGH) — Entity Identification
4. **TRC-001** (HIGH) — Forward Traceability
5. **DOC-001** (CRITICAL) — Deliberate Omissions

Mark review as "PARTIAL" if not all domains completed.

## COVERAGE (COV)

> **Standard**: [ISO 21511:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/69702.html) §4.2 — WBS 100% Rule
>
> "The WBS must include 100% of the work defined by the scope and capture all deliverables."

### COV-001: Design Element Coverage (100% Rule)
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Ref**: ISO 21511:2018 §4.2 (WBS 100% rule)

- [ ] ALL components from DESIGN are assigned to at least one feature
- [ ] ALL sequences/flows from DESIGN are assigned to at least one feature
- [ ] ALL data entities from DESIGN are assigned to at least one feature
- [ ] ALL design principles from DESIGN are assigned to at least one feature
- [ ] ALL design constraints from DESIGN are assigned to at least one feature
- [ ] No orphaned design elements (elements not in any feature)

**Verification method**: Cross-reference DESIGN IDs with DECOMPOSITION references.

### COV-002: Requirements Coverage Passthrough
**Severity**: HIGH
**Ref**: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §6.5 (Traceability)

- [ ] ALL functional requirements (FR) from PRD are covered by at least one feature
- [ ] ALL non-functional requirements (NFR) from PRD are covered by at least one feature
- [ ] No orphaned requirements (requirements not in any feature)

**Note**: This verifies that the decomposition covers requirements transitively through DESIGN.

### COV-003: Coverage Mapping Completeness
**Severity**: HIGH

- [ ] Each feature explicitly lists "Requirements Covered" with IDs
- [ ] Each feature explicitly lists "Design Components" with IDs
- [ ] Each feature explicitly lists "Sequences" with IDs (or "None")
- [ ] Each feature explicitly lists "Data" with IDs (or "None")
- [ ] No implicit or assumed coverage

---

## EXCLUSIVITY (EXC)

> **Standard**: [ISO 21511:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/69702.html) §4.2 — Mutual Exclusivity
>
> "Work packages should be mutually exclusive to avoid double-counting and ambiguity."

### EXC-001: Scope Non-Overlap
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Ref**: ISO 21511:2018 §4.2 (Mutual exclusivity)

- [ ] Features do not overlap in scope (each deliverable assigned to exactly one feature)
- [ ] No duplicate coverage of the same design element by multiple features without explicit reason
- [ ] Responsibility for each deliverable is unambiguous
- [ ] No "shared" scope that could cause confusion about ownership

**Verification method**: Check if any design element ID appears in multiple features' references.

### EXC-002: Boundary Clarity
**Severity**: HIGH

- [ ] Each feature has clear "Scope" boundaries (what's in)
- [ ] Each feature has clear "Out of Scope" boundaries (what's explicitly excluded)
- [ ] Boundaries between adjacent features are explicit and non-ambiguous
- [ ] Domain entities are assigned to single feature (or clear reason for sharing)

### EXC-003: Dependency vs Overlap Distinction
**Severity**: MEDIUM

- [ ] Dependencies (one feature uses output of another) are clearly distinct from overlaps
- [ ] Shared components are documented as dependencies, not duplicate scope
- [ ] Integration points are explicit

- [ ] Type indicates nature: core, supporting, infrastructure, integration, etc.
- [ ] Types are consistent across similar features

### ATTR-003: Entity Purpose
**Severity**: HIGH
**Ref**: IEEE 1016-2009 §5.4.1 (purpose attribute)

- [ ] Each feature has clear one-line **Purpose** statement

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Ref**: IEEE 1016-2009 §5.4.1 (subordinates attribute)

- [ ] Each feature documents phases/milestones (subordinate decomposition)
- [ ] Or explicitly states "single phase" / no sub-decomposition needed
- [ ] Subordinates represent meaningful implementation milestones

### LEV-003: Phase Balance
**Severity**: LOW

- [ ] Phase/milestone counts are roughly balanced across features
- [ ] No feature has disproportionately many phases (>5x average)
