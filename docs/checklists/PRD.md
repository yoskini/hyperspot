## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates PRD artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report
- [ ] I will use the [Reporting](#reporting) format for output (see end of document)

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the product's domain** — What kind of product is this PRD for? (e.g., consumer app, enterprise platform, developer tool, internal system)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all PRDs:
   - An internal tool PRD may not need market positioning analysis
   - A developer framework PRD may not need end-user personas
   - A methodology PRD may not need regulatory compliance analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Applicability Determination

**For items marked "(if applicable)"**, determine applicability using these criteria:

| Domain | Applicable When | Not Applicable When |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Market positioning (BIZ-PRD-002) | External product, competitive market | Internal tool, no competitors |
| SSO/federation (SEC-PRD-001) | Enterprise product, multi-tenant | Single-user tool, local-only |
| Privacy by Design (SEC-PRD-005) | Handles EU personal data, PII | No personal data processing |
| Safety (SAFE-PRD-001/002) | Could harm people/property/environment, medical devices, vehicles, industrial | Pure information system, no physical interaction |
| Regulatory (COMPL-PRD-001) | Handles PII, financial data, healthcare | Internal dev tool, no user data |
| Accessibility (UX-PRD-002) | Public-facing, government, enterprise | Internal tool with known user base |
| Inclusivity (UX-PRD-005) | Diverse user base, public-facing | Narrow technical audience, internal tool |
| Internationalization (UX-PRD-003) | Multi-region deployment planned | Single-locale deployment |
| Offline capability (UX-PRD-004) | Mobile app, unreliable network | Server-side tool, always-connected |

**When uncertain**: Mark as applicable and let the PRD author explicitly exclude with reasoning.

---

## Checkpointing (Long Reviews)

This checklist is 700+ lines. For reviews that may exceed context limits:

### Checkpoint After Each Domain

After completing each expertise domain (BIZ, ARCH, SEC, etc.), output:
```
✓ {DOMAIN} complete: {N} items checked, {M} issues found
Issues: {list issue IDs}
Remaining: {list unchecked domains}
```

### If Context Runs Low

1. **Save progress**: List completed domains and issues found so far
2. **Note position**: "Stopped at {DOMAIN}-{ID}"
3. **Resume instruction**: "Continue from {DOMAIN}-{ID}, issues so far: {list}"

### Minimum Viable Review

If full review impossible, prioritize in this order:
1. **BIZ** (CRITICAL) — Vision, Requirements, Use Cases
2. **ARCH-PRD-001** (CRITICAL) — Scope Boundaries
3. **SEC-PRD-001/002** (CRITICAL) — Auth/Authorization
4. **DOC-PRD-001** (CRITICAL) — Deliberate Omissions
5. **MUST NOT HAVE** (all CRITICAL/HIGH items)

Mark review as "PARTIAL" if not all domains completed.

- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact (or note "No mention found")
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix (what to change/add/remove) with clear acceptance criteria

Recommended output format for chat:

## PR Review Focus (Requirements)

When reviewing PRs that add or change PRD/requirements documents, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Completeness and clarity of requirements
- [ ] Testability and acceptance criteria for every requirement
- [ ] Traceability to business goals and stated problems
- [ ] Compliance with `docs/spec-templates/cf-sdlc/PRD/template.md` template structure
- [ ] Alignment with best industry standard practices for large SaaS systems and platforms
- [ ] Critical assessment of requirements quality — challenge vague, overlapping, or untestable items
- [ ] Split findings by checklist category and rate each 1-10
- [ ] Ensure requirements are aligned with the project's existing architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md`)
