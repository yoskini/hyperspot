## Review Scope Selection

**Choose review mode based on DESIGN scope and change type**:

| Review Mode | When to Use | Domains to Check |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Quick** | Minor updates, <3 sections changed | ARCH (core only) + changed domains |
| **Standard** | New DESIGN, moderate changes | All applicable domains |
| **Full** | Major architectural changes, compliance-critical | All 12 domains with evidence |

### Quick Review (ARCH Core Only)

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-001: Architecture Overview Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-004: Component Model Quality
- [ ] ARCH-DESIGN-005: Domain Model Authority
- [ ] DOC-DESIGN-001: Explicit Non-Applicability

**Changed sections** — also check relevant domain items for any sections modified.

### Domain Prioritization by System Type

| System Type | Priority Domains (check first) | Secondary Domains | Often N/A |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Web Service** | ARCH, SEC, REL, DATA, INT | PERF, OPS, TEST | UX, COMPL |
| **CLI Tool** | ARCH, MAINT, TEST | DATA, INT | SEC, PERF, OPS, COMPL, UX |
| **Data Pipeline** | ARCH, DATA, REL, PERF | INT, OPS | SEC, UX, COMPL |
| **Methodology/Framework** | ARCH, MAINT | TEST | SEC, PERF, REL, DATA, INT, OPS, COMPL, UX |
| **Mobile App** | ARCH, UX, SEC, PERF | DATA, TEST | OPS, INT, COMPL |

**Applicability Rule**: Domains in "Often N/A" column still require explicit "Not applicable because..." statement in document if skipped.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates DESIGN artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Evidence Requirements (STRICT mode)

**When Rules Mode = STRICT** (per `agent-compliance.md`):

### For Each Checklist Category

Agent MUST output evidence in this format:

| Category ID | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001 | PASS | Lines 45-67: "System purpose is to provide..." |
| ARCH-DESIGN-002 | PASS | Section B.1 contains 9 principles with unique IDs |
| PERF-DESIGN-001 | N/A | Line 698: "Performance architecture not applicable..." |

### Evidence Standards

**For PASS**:
- Quote 2-5 sentences from document proving requirement is met
- Include line numbers or section references
- Evidence must directly demonstrate compliance

**For N/A (Not Applicable)**:
- Quote the **explicit** "Not applicable because..." statement from document
- If no explicit statement exists → report as VIOLATION, not N/A
- Agent CANNOT decide N/A on author's behalf — document must state it

**For FAIL**:
- State what's missing or incorrect
- Provide location where it should be
- Quote surrounding context

### Why Evidence Matters

Without evidence requirements, agents exhibit anti-pattern AP-004 (BULK_PASS):
- Report "all checks pass" without actually verifying each item
- Skip tedious checklist review
- Produce invalid validation that misses real issues

**Real example of this failure**:
> Agent reported "DESIGN validation PASS" without reading the file, because deterministic gate passed and agent assumed semantic review was optional.

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the artifact's domain** — What kind of system/project is this DESIGN for? (e.g., web service, CLI tool, data pipeline, methodology framework)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all designs:
   - A CLI tool design may not need Security Architecture analysis
   - A methodology framework design may not need Performance Architecture analysis
   - A local development tool design may not need Operations Architecture analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

# Validation Summary

## Final Checklist

Confirm before reporting results:

- [ ] I checked ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I verified ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I documented all violations found
- [ ] I provided specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] All critical issues have been reported

### Explicit Handling Verification

For each major checklist category (ARCH, PERF, SEC, REL, DATA, INT, OPS, MAINT, TEST, COMPL, UX, BIZ), confirm:

- [ ] Category is addressed in the document, OR
- [ ] Category is explicitly marked "Not applicable" with reasoning in the document, OR
- [ ] Category absence is reported as a violation (with applicability justification)

**No silent omissions allowed** — every category must have explicit disposition

---

## Reporting Readiness Checklist

- [ ] I will report every identified issue (no omissions)
- [ ] I will report only issues (no "everything looks good" sections)
- [ ] I will use the exact report format defined below (no deviations)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Why Applicable (applicability justification)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Evidence (quote/location)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Why it matters (impact)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include a Proposal (concrete fix + acceptance criteria)
- [ ] I will avoid vague statements and use precise, verifiable language

---

## Reporting

Report **only** problems (do not list what is OK).

For each issue include:

- **Why Applicable**: Explain why this requirement applies to this specific DESIGN's context (e.g., "This DESIGN describes a web service architecture, therefore security architecture is required")
- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact (or note "No mention found")
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix (what to change/add/remove) with clear acceptance criteria

### Full Report Format (Standard/Full Reviews)

```markdown
## Review Report (Issues Only)

### 1. {Short issue title}

**Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}

**Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW

#### Why Applicable

{Explain why this requirement applies to this DESIGN's context. E.g., "This DESIGN describes a distributed system architecture, therefore reliability architecture is required."}

#### Issue

{What is wrong — requirement is missing, incomplete, or not explicitly marked as not applicable}

#### Evidence

{Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact. If requirement is missing entirely, state "No mention of [requirement] found in the document"}

#### Why It Matters

{Impact: risk, cost, user harm, compliance}

#### Proposal

{Concrete fix: what to change/add/remove, with clear acceptance criteria}

```

### Compact Report Format (Quick Reviews)

For quick reviews, use this condensed table format:

```markdown
## DESIGN Review Summary

| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposal |
|----|----------|-------|----------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001 | HIGH | Missing context diagram | Add system context diagram to Section A |
| ARCH-DESIGN-005 | MEDIUM | No schema location | Add path to domain types in Section C.1 |

**Applicability**: {System type} — checked {N} priority domains, {M} marked N/A
```

## Reporting Commitment

- [ ] I reported all issues I found
- [ ] I used the exact report format defined in this checklist (no deviations)
- [ ] I included Why Applicable justification for each issue
- [ ] I included evidence and impact for each issue
- [ ] I proposed concrete fixes for each issue
- [ ] I did not hide or omit known problems
- [ ] I verified explicit handling for all major checklist categories
- [ ] I am ready to iterate on the proposals and re-review after changes

## PR Review Focus (Design)

When reviewing PRs that add or change design documents, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Alignment with existing architecture (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md`)
- [ ] Trade-off analysis — are alternatives considered and justified?
- [ ] API contract consistency with existing endpoints and conventions
- [ ] Security considerations — authentication, authorization, data protection
- [ ] Compliance with `docs/spec-templates/cf-sdlc/DESIGN/template.md` template structure
- [ ] Identify antipatterns — god objects, leaky abstractions, tight coupling
- [ ] Compare proposed design with existing industry patterns in SaaS platforms
- [ ] Compare proposed design with IEEE, ISO, and other industry standards where applicable
- [ ] Critical assessment of design decisions — challenge assumptions and gaps
- [ ] Split findings by checklist category and rate each 1-10
