## Review Scope Selection

**Choose review mode based on feature complexity and risk**:

| Review Mode | When to Use | Domains to Check |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Quick** | Simple CRUD, minor updates | ARCH (core) + BIZ + changed domains |
| **Standard** | New feature, moderate complexity | All applicable domains |
| **Full** | Security-sensitive, complex logic | All 12 domains with evidence |

### Quick Review (Core Items Only)

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] ARCH-FDESIGN-001: Feature Context Completeness
- [ ] ARCH-FDESIGN-003: Actor Flow Completeness
- [ ] BIZ-FDESIGN-001: Requirements Alignment
- [ ] DOC-FDESIGN-001: Explicit Non-Applicability

**Changed sections** — also check relevant domain items for any sections modified.

### Domain Prioritization by Feature Type

| Feature Type | Priority Domains (check first) | Secondary Domains | Often N/A |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **User-facing UI** | ARCH, UX, SEC, TEST | PERF, REL, DATA | OPS, INT, COMPL |
| **Backend API** | ARCH, SEC, DATA, INT | PERF, REL, TEST | UX, COMPL |
| **Data Processing** | ARCH, DATA, PERF, REL | INT, TEST | SEC, UX, OPS, COMPL |
| **CLI Command** | ARCH, MAINT, TEST | DATA, INT | SEC, PERF, UX, OPS, COMPL |
| **Integration/Webhook** | ARCH, INT, SEC, REL | DATA, TEST | UX, PERF, OPS, COMPL |
| **Auth/Security** | SEC, ARCH, DATA, REL | TEST, COMPL | UX, PERF, OPS, INT |

**Applicability Rule**: Domains in "Often N/A" column still require explicit "Not applicable because..." statement in document if skipped.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates FEATURE artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the feature's domain** — What kind of feature is this? (e.g., user-facing UI feature, backend API feature, data processing pipeline, CLI command)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all features:
   - A simple CRUD feature may not need complex State Management analysis
   - A read-only feature may not need Data Integrity analysis
   - A CLI feature may not need UI/UX analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

# Validation Summary

## Final Checklist

Confirm before reporting results:

- [ ] I checked ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I verified ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I documented all violations found
- [ ] I provided specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] All critical issues have been reported

### Explicit Handling Verification

For each major checklist category (ARCH, PERF, SEC, REL, DATA, INT, OPS, MAINT, TEST, COMPL, UX, BIZ), confirm:

- [ ] Category is addressed in the document, OR
- [ ] Category is explicitly marked "Not applicable" with reasoning in the document, OR
- [ ] Category absence is reported as a violation (with applicability justification)

**No silent omissions allowed** — every category must have explicit disposition

---

## Reporting Readiness Checklist

- [ ] I will report every identified issue (no omissions)
- [ ] I will report only issues (no "everything looks good" sections)
- [ ] I will use the exact report format defined below (no deviations)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Why Applicable (applicability justification)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Evidence (quote/location)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include Why it matters (impact)
- [ ] Each reported issue will include a Proposal (concrete fix + acceptance criteria)
- [ ] I will avoid vague statements and use precise, verifiable language

---

## Reporting

Report **only** problems (do not list what is OK).

For each issue include:

- **Why Applicable**: Explain why this requirement applies to this specific feature's context (e.g., "This feature handles user authentication, therefore security analysis is required")
- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact (or note "No mention found")
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix (what to change/add/remove) with clear acceptance criteria

### Full Report Format (Standard/Full Reviews)

```markdown
## Review Report (Issues Only)

### 1. {Short issue title}

**Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}

**Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW

#### Why Applicable

{Explain why this requirement applies to this feature's context. E.g., "This feature processes user data, therefore data integrity analysis is required."}

#### Issue

{What is wrong — requirement is missing, incomplete, or not explicitly marked as not applicable}

#### Evidence

{Quote the exact text or describe the exact location in the artifact. If requirement is missing entirely, state "No mention of [requirement] found in the document"}

#### Why It Matters

{Impact: risk, cost, user harm, compliance}

#### Proposal

{Concrete fix: what to change/add/remove, with clear acceptance criteria}

### 2. {Short issue title}
...
```

### Compact Report Format (Quick Reviews)

For quick reviews, use this condensed table format:

```markdown
## FEATURE Review Summary

| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposal |
|----|----------|-------|----------|
| ARCH-FDESIGN-001 | HIGH | Missing feature scope | Add scope statement to Section A |
| BIZ-FDESIGN-001 | MEDIUM | No PRD traceability | Add requirement references |

**Applicability**: {Feature type} — checked {N} priority domains, {M} marked N/A

```
